# Project-Euler
A Node.js approach to solving the [Project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

The purpose of this repo is to familiarize with the JavaScript language and NOT to solve Project Euler problems efficiently.
If the purpose was to solve Project Euler as efficiently as possible then JavaScript should not be the language to achieve this.

I just wanted to have some fun while learning JavaScript. This is much more engaging than copying textbook examples :)

## How to run
Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
To run, enter the following command:
```
node p1.js
```
The output will be a number that corresponds to the answer to that problem.
